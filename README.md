Interactive data visaulization via hierachical cluster analysis (HCA).
Original source code from: https://jokergoo.github.io/InteractiveComplexHeatmap/articles/share.html

There are two versions of the HCA, one for average values (across 6 visits) and the other for values per each single visit. In each folder: <br />

  app.R : containing R code that generates the interactive heatmap. <br />
  htShiny.RData : containing all R objects needed for heatmap (loaded in app.R.) <br />
  htShiny.sh, and htShiny.bat : these can be run in the terminal under Linux/MacOS or Windows. <br />

An easy way to access the interactive heatmaps is to open the app.R file on R studio and run the script. <br />
You will not need to have installed the InteractiveComplexHeatmap package, since app.R will install it automatically if not already installed.
